Kaizen Manager (Kaizen for short) is an open source, minimal project management web-based software. 

## What's Kaizen?

Kaizen (改善) is a Japanese word that means "improvement". We want this software to not only improve your task/project management, but also for this software to continuously improve by having it open sourced. 

In Kaizen, user(s) can setup and have multiple projects under each workspace, keeping track of their tasks and checking out metrics to understand team (or solo) performance.
